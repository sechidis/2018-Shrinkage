# 2018-Efficient Feature Selection Using Shrinkage Estimators


Matlab code for the methods presented in the paper **(under review)** <br/>
Efficient Feature Selection Using Shrinkage Estimators, K. Sechidis, L. Azzimonti, G. Corani, J. Weatherall, G. Brown <br/>

## Novel Shrinkage estimators (Section 3)
* mi_Ind_JS.m - Implements our shrinkage estimator for mutual information (Section 3.2)
* cmi_Ind_JS.m - Implements our shrinkage estimator for conditional mutual information (Section 3.3)

## Novel High-order FS criteria (Section 4)
* JMI3.m - Implements our FS method JMI-3 that takes into account third-order feature interactions (Section 4.2)
* JMI4.m - Implements our FS method JMI-4 that takes into account fourth-order feature interactions (Section 4.2) 
* CMIM3.m - Implements our FS method CMIM-3 that takes into account third-order feature interactions (Section 4.2)
* CMIM4.m - Implements our FS method CMIM-4 that takes into account fourth-order feature interactions (Section 4.2)

## Tutorial
The tutorial 'Tutorial_Shrinakge_FS.m' presents how to select features using our suggested methods
