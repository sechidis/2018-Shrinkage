Matlab code for the methods presented in the paper **(under review)** <br/>
Efficient Feature Selection Using Shrinkage Estimators, K. Sechidis, L. Azzimonti, G. Corani, J. Weatherall, G. Brown <br/>

## Novel High-order FS criteria (Section 3)
* JMIMplus.m - Implements our FS method JMI+ that takes into account high-order feature interactions (Section 3.2)
* CMIMplus.m - Implements our FS method CMIM+ that takes into account high-order feature interactions (Section 3.2)

## Novel Shrinkage estimators (Section 4)
* mi_Ind_JS.m - Implements our shrinkage estimator for mutual information (Section 4.1)
* cmi_Ind_JS.m - Implements our shrinkage estimator for conditional mutual information (Section 4.2)

## Tutorial
The tutorial 'Tutorial_Shrinakge_FS.m' presents how to select features using our suggested methods
